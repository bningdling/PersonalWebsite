This psychological experience is referred to as ‚Äúmisarticulation‚Äù, meaning the subjective sense of not having fully expressed or communicated what one has in mind. While existing literature focuses more on the underlying process of information transmission in communications, misarticulation highlights the experience of the communicators themselves. This study uses Natural Language Processing techniques to explore whether misarticulation is predictable through texts.",

Evidence shows that Hong Kong intellectuals play a crucial role in propagating nationalism-related ideologies as influencers on the internet, while the Chinese State media seeks to use the technology to channel public opinion, resulting in a widened gap between Hong Kong and China in the age of social media.",
