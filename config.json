Some of these would be preventable with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which restore normal heart rhythm, but the vast majority of deaths lack known risk factors pre-mortem. We draw on a dataset of over 400,000 ECGs from a regional health system in Sweden, linked to death certificates, and train a residual neural network to predict sudden cardiac death. In an independent validation set of patients from the same region, we show that our model capably automates the prediction of sudden cardiac death, performing comparably to best-fit models on extensive patient medical history.",

We refer to this psychological experience as ‚Äúmisarticulation‚Äù, meaning the subjective sense of not having fully expressed or communicated what one has in mind. While existing literature focuses more on the underlying process of information transmission in communications, misarticulation highlights the experience of the communicators themselves. This study uses Natural Language Processing techniques to explore whether misarticulation is predictable through texts.",
